# Cursor Swapper

`Client side` mod that allows swapping of the game cursor. The cursor will update immediately as long as there is
a `cursor.png` file
located somewhere in your BepInEx/plugins folder and the "Use Custom Cursor" configuration option is
on. `You can hotswap cursors! Just update the file inside your folder.`

If you have changed your cursor at least once, but wish to return to the vanilla cursor. You can do so by renaming or
removing the `cursor.png` file, as well as changing the config option "Use Custom Cursor" to be Off.

- Recommended size of the cursor image is 32x32. You can find success with bigger images though! I personally would stay
  64x64 and below.
