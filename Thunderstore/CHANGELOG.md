|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1.1.4       | - Compatibility with Jewelcrafting overwriting the cursor during loading while connecting to a server. (Basically writes our texture back to it after JC is done). |
| 1.1.3       | - Courtesy update for Valheim 0.217.22, nothing changed except a version bump.                                                                                     |
| 1.1.1/1.1.2 | - Remove ServerSync, not sure why I had it here. It's not needed, and would cause issues for Crossplay.                                                            |
| 1.1.0       | - No longer require reboot to apply changes to the cursor.                                                                                                         |
| 1.0.0       | - Initial Release                                                                                                                                                  |
